# TODO:

> ## Implement timers for quests
> ### quests happen automatically, without user input
> - maybe have user input inbetween stages (ie, quest is ten minutes, broken into four stages, quest will pause until user provides input)
> ### Quests have a set amount of time to complete, specified in the DB
> - Periodically check all running quests, and see if they should be finished (?)

***
> ## Implement the viewquest page
> ### Refresh page when quest is complete
> - or go to new quest completed page
> ### see status of quest (stages completed)
> - characters will face challenges to be overcome, character and gear selection will influence quest success chance
